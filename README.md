# Kodi Livecoding.tv Video Add-on

Watch your favorite lctv livestreams and videos on Kodi® (formerly known as XBMC™), see https://kodi.tv/.


# Known issues

* I am having issues with the playback of streams (buffering, dropping, stuttering etc.).

> This add-on does not handle any aspect of the playback of lctv livestreams / videos, it just tells Kodi® what to play.

# Todo

* Implement initial video add-on for watching current livestreams (see https://www.livecoding.tv/developer/documentation/)
* Adapt repository to fit Kodi requirements for video add-ons (see http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_Rules)
* Submit add-on to Kodi (see http://kodi.wiki/view/Submitting_Add-ons)
* Roadmap


# Developers

* Contributions are welcome. :)
